# Humanoid Detection

## Description
This project is a collection of Python programs designed to detect a person in a video frame and output "Human in frame" to the console. The goal is to recognize the presence of a human without drawing a bounding box or marking them visually.

### Features
- Simple detection of a human in the frame.
- Output message "Human in frame" to the console.
- Does not currently include any bounding box drawing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library: `pip install opencv-python`

### Running the Program
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/taylorking01/humanoid-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd humanoid-detection
    ```
3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python detect_human.py
    ```

### Future Goals
- Add bounding box for visualizing human detection.
- Implement behavior recognition (walking, running, jumping).
